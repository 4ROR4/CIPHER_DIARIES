***
A collection of Cipher implementations in different langauges.

## What is a cipher?
**In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure.**

## Why this repository?
Learning cipher algorithms and getting started with open source contribution are the two main ojectives of this repository.
